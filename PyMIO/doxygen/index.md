@section Introduction PyMIO Introduction

This document describes how to use the XMPP based libMIO API. These tools enable devices to commmunicate device and sensor data via a XMPP server. This api relies on the libstrophe C XMPP library.

@section Installation

PyMIO is written for Python2.7. It relies on SleekXMPP for clientside XMPP communication. The SleekXMPP source can be found at https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP. It is also possible to use 'pip install sleekxmpp'.

For its useful logging capabilities coloredlogs is also necessary, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coloredlogs.
